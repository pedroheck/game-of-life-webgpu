      }

      // Now, the first step in initializing WebGPU is to request a GPUAdapter.
      // A GPUAdapter represents the user's GPU and serves as a bridge between the application 
      // (which uses WebGPU) and the actual GPU in the user's device.
      // It's like a guidebook or instruction manual that tells you how to communicate with the GPU.
      // Note: We use "await" because the GPUAdapter may not be ready right away,
      // so the application remains paused until it gets what it requested
      const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter(); // "Hey, can I have the GPUAdapter please?"
      
      if (!adapter){
        throw new Error("No appropriate GPUAdapter found.");

      // Now, the last step before working with GPU is to request a GPUDevice.

      // It's the part of WebGPU that allows you to send commands directly to the GPU.
      const device = await adapter.requestDevice();

      // Now we need to configure the canvas to be used with the device we created.
      // The GPUCanvasContext allows the GPU to draw on the canvas. It's like setting up your paintbrush
      // with the correct paint before you start painting. That is, we're telling the GPUDevice
      // (the remote control) to use the GPUCanvasContext (the special paint).

      // The context it returns must be associated with the device using the configure() method
      // When we're setting up the GPUCanvasContext with the configure() method, there are 
      // a few options we can provide. The most important ones are the device and the format.
      context.configure({
